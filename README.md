## ÔøΩ PDwF Processing Architecture

The PDF quiz feature uses a robust server-side approach:

1. **File Upload:** Frontend sends PDF via FormData to `/api/extract-pdf`
2. **Server Processing:** Uses `pdf-parse` library to extract text from PDF
3. **Text Validation:** Ensures readable text is found (not scanned images)
4. **Quiz Generation:** Extracted text is sent to Gemini API via `/api/pdf-quiz`
5. **Question Display:** Generated questions are displayed in the quiz interface

**Key Dependencies:**
- `pdf-parse` - Server-side PDF text extraction
- `formidable` - Handles multipart file uploads
- `@types/pdf-parse` & `@types/formidable` - TypeScript support

## üìù How It Works

- **General Knowledge:**  
  Select your quiz options, and Gemini generates 5/10/20 MCQs in real time.

- **PDF Quiz:**  
  Upload a PDF, the server extracts its text using pdf-parse, and Gemini generates a quiz based on your document content.

- **Quiz Flow:**  
  - Select an answer, click Next, and see your score at the end.
  - Retry the quiz or return to the home page.

## ÔøΩ TroDubleshooting

### PDF Upload Issues
- **"No text found in PDF":** The PDF might be a scanned image. Try a PDF with selectable text.
- **Upload fails:** Check file size (default limit: ~10MB) and ensure it's a valid PDF.
- **Processing slow:** Large PDFs take longer to process. The app shows a loading indicator.

### API Issues
- **Quiz generation fails:** Verify your `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set correctly in `.env.local`.
- **Server errors:** Check the console for detailed error messages.
